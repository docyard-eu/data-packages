Dear Jordan,

I hope this message finds you well. This
morning's walk was brightened by the lush
green of the spring leaves. In the town
square, I was delighted by the sight of
children drawing squares with chalk on
the pavement. It's moments like these,
where color and shape intersect in
everyday life, that remind me of the
beauty in simplicity.

Take care,

Alex
