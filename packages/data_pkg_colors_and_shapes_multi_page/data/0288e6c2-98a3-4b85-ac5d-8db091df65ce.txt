Dear Jordan,

I hope this letter finds you in good
spirits. Yesterday, I stumbled upon an
intriguing painting dominated by the
vibrant hue of blue. Later, as I walked
through the park, I noticed a child
playing with a triangle-shaped kite. It's
fascinating how the simple presence of a
color or a shape can evoke such unique
emotions and memories. I look forward to
discussing these artistic elements with
you soon.

Warm regards,
Alex
