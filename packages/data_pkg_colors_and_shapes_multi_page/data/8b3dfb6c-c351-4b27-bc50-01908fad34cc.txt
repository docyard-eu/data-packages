Dear Jordan,

I hope this letter finds you in great
health and high spirits. Just this
morning, I was captivated by the deep red
of the sunrise that filled the sky. Later,
while walking downtown, I couldn't help
but notice the intricate circles that
adorned the new art installation at the
plaza. It's remarkable how a distinct
color and shape can add so much character
and life to our surroundings.

Best wishes,

Alex
